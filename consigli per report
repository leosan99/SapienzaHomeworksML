Yes, it is possible for the training accuracy to be low during certain epochs while achieving a high accuracy on the test set or during predictions. This situation can be observed due to several reasons:

    Early Stopping:
        If you are using techniques like early stopping, the training process might stop before the model has fully converged. In such cases, the training accuracy might be lower than what the model can achieve given more training epochs.

    Learning Rate and Optimization Dynamics:
        The learning rate and optimization algorithm can influence the training process. If the learning rate is too high, the model might oscillate or overshoot the optimal weights, leading to slower convergence. Adjusting the learning rate or using adaptive optimizers might help.

    Model Complexity and Overfitting:
        If the model is too complex or has a large number of parameters, it might start memorizing the training data (overfitting) rather than learning general patterns. In this case, the training accuracy may be high, but the model may perform poorly on new, unseen data.

    Imbalanced Classes:
        If the dataset has imbalanced classes, the training accuracy might be influenced by the dominant class. The model might become biased towards predicting the majority class. Evaluating on a balanced test set provides a more realistic assessment.

    Data Augmentation and Regularization:
        Techniques like data augmentation during training and regularization can influence the model's behavior. Data augmentation introduces variations in the training data, and regularization helps prevent overfitting.

To better understand the model's performance, it's essential to look at metrics on both the training and test sets. If there is a significant discrepancy, it might indicate issues such as overfitting, underfitting, or problems with the training process. Monitoring additional metrics, using validation sets, and experimenting with model architecture and hyperparameters can help improve overall performance.
